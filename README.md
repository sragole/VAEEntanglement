# VAEEntanglement
This repository contains code which explores the question, can an [algorithm](./3QubitVariationalAutoEncoder.ipynb) learn to distinguish quantum states which are known to be distinct in the way they are entangled? For those in a hurry, the answer for 3 qubits is maybe, but this approach should fail in general. My limited understanding is that entanglement witnesses are generically hard, and for mixed states, the problem is NP-hard [1](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=780542.780545). However, it was a fun exercise to teach myself about variational autoencoders.

The main result is linked above (which I'm working on making more accessible), and my generated data is included. This [notebook](./Classifier%20Test.ipynb) has some scratch work on 2 qubit systems.

This work was the result of collaboration between a group of ML-interested physicists at the University of Maryland, Zach Eldredge, who led an [effort](https://github.com/zeldredge/py-nqs) to reproduce code from 10.1126/science.aag2302, and Alireza Seif, who recently posted a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.07718) using neural networks to improve experimental detection.

I also using [QuTip](http://qutip.org/index.html), a fantastic simulation tool, to simulate the quantum dynamics and [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) for the machine learning part.

## Introduction
The proper background for the work included here is usually covered in multiple semester long courses in college, so I will not attempt to reproduce that. Instead, I will try to give a brief overview so that the ML people can understand the data and the physics people can understand the machine learning.

## Density matrices and quantum physics
As you may have heard, quantum mechanics is a theory which describes the world outside of normal classical physics. It is hard to see many quantum effects at room temperature but precise control of lasers, good refridgeration, and other techniques have opened up a world of exploration for physicists. Additionally, our understanding of this theory underlies a lot of important technology, including [lasers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser), [transistors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor), and precise sensors (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQUID). Typically, popular science makes a big deal about two effects, superposition and entanglement. I am focusing on the latter.

Without a proper introduction, I will simply state that a [quantum state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_state) is full described by its wavefunction, typically written as $|\psi\rangle$. $|\psi\rangle$ contains all the information needed to the expected value of measurements and the probability of the outcomes, which is all we have access to in the lab. You can get pretty far thinking of $|\psi\rangle$ as a vector in a high dimensional space. The expected value are simply the inner product with the relevant measurement operator, which can be thought of as a matrix, $\langle M\rangle = \langle \psi | M|\psi \rangle$. This is a perfectly good representation of quantum mechanics in closed systems. A lot of the work of experimental physics is making sure that we can pretend the system is closed, with good reason, open systems are hard. 

To describe open systems, we need to move to a representation called the [density matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_matrix). For pure states, the density matrix $\rho = |\psi\rangle \langle \psi | $ is effectively just a matrix form of the state above. However, it also opens the door for classical randomness, the type we see when we don't know all the details of the world. This randomness is separate from the type that occurs in pure states. As an example, for a quantum system with states $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$, the state $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(|0\rangle+|1\rangle\right)$ will produce either state with equal probability upon measurement. However, a simply rotation (either of the state or the measurement basis) will result in the same outcome every time, showing that the state really is what is known as a superposition. However, we can also consider a system where someone flips a coin and gives us either $|0\rangle$ or $|1\rangle$. This system will also give random results, even if we rotate it. To represent such a system, we need a density matrix.
